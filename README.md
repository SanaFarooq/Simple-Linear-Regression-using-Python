# Simple-Linear-Regression-using-Python
I will be using a Simple Linear Regression model to predict the salary of employed professionals based on their years of experience.

Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.

The key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the dependent variable must be a continuous/real value. However, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values.

# Data Set is also attached.

Data set i have used is small data set just for understanding how linear regression work. you can use any dataset of your choice. 

# Libraies Used in this project are:
1. Numpy
2. Mathplotlib
3. pandas
# How to install the Libraries:
if you are using Anaconda notepad or Google Colabs then on google colabs these libraries are pre installed. 
but for anaconda you need to run the following commands on your CMD 
-pip install pandas
-pip install mathplotlib
-pip install Numpy

For more data science Machine learning Algorithms stay tuned.
Kind regards,
Sana Farooq.
